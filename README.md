My homepage

I used the help of "https://css-tricks.com/a-few-background-patterns-sites/" and "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.cssto" help design the background and social media icon. Altering the color and design to fit what style I wanted.

This is my homepage, there is about me, contact and portfolio pages that are all linked together. 

Here is a link to Brian's homepage, "https://btoney1988.github.io/brian_toney/"
