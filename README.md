## My homepage

* I used the help of "https://css-tricks.com/a-few-background-patterns-sites/" and "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.cssto" help design the background and social media icon. Altering the color and design to fit what style I wanted.

* This is my homepage, there is about me, portfolio and contact pages that are all linked together. I included two contact pages. One being the one for the assignment. One being a more professional contact page as per "Intro to Career Services: Employer-Ready vs Employer-Competitive." For the portfolio page I used the image of myself until I have things to insert into the page.
